<h1>About LesRoutes</h1>
<p>LesRoutes is a rails-based web app that allows you to create and manage routes for Google Maps.<br><br>
Its core function is to allow users to create routes with up to 9 destinations. The app uses the Mapbox-API to display the selected destinations on a map and calculates the travel time and distance for the selected route mode (walking, cycling, driving). Users can re-arrange route stops (sortable.js) and, once they are done, are redirected to the Google Maps App, where the navigation begins. Google Maps does not allow multi-stop routes to be saved, which means that once a multi-stop route is created in Google Maps and the navigation is stopped, there is no way to get back to the created route. LesRoutes aims to fill this gap. <br><br>
Users can share their routes via SMS, Whatsapp and Email. The receiver gets a Google Maps link that allows him/her to start navigation along the specific route without the need to have a LesRoutes account. Furthermore, users can share their routes to the <a href="https://www.lesroutes.co.uk/routes/public"  target="_blank">LesRoutes Community</a> from where un-registered users can display the route and start navigation. This feature is meant to allow travel bloggers to create routes along interesting locations and provide their users with a ready-to-go route-link.
For now, LesRoutes is only available for smartphones.<br><br>

The app is based on <a href="http://www.my-routes.co.uk" target="_blank">myRoutes</a>, a MVP created during Le Wagon's full-time web development bootcamp. However, it fixes key backend-issues that MyRoutes still has and adds new features (more route-modes, route-sharing and many more.)
